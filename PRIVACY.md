# Privacy Policy
## Collected data
In order to function, Alex collects command response text and a few Discord-provided IDs. These are the things that are collected and stored indefinitely:
- Server, channel, and message IDs
- User and role IDs
- User provided messages sent through the bot, eg. via the feedback feature
- Anything provided through commands, eg. server descriptions or configuration data
- Daily backups of the above

## Usage
Data collected by the bot is used in a few ways:
### Server, channel, and message IDs
Server IDs are used primarily to differentiate data related to one server or another. For example, a server ID is stored for every listing registered to the bot,
to make sure that one only has access to their server's listings.

Channel IDs are typically used to remember which channel certain things should go to- for example, where edit requests should be forwarded. They also help to differentiate
which channel a message is in.

Message IDs are stored to remember which messages have been posted by the bot, and are used to update those posts accordingly.

### User and role IDs
User IDs are stored to differentiate between users that have added data to the bot, as well as to be able to mark those users as contacts on servers. 
They're primarily collected for the contacts and feedback features.

Role IDs are stored as part of reaction roles, and are collected to help the bot know which roles to add or remove from users.

### User provided messages
If a server has the feedback feature enabled, it acts as a modmail system, allowing users to send messages to the server. The content of these messages is stored to
allow moderators to call up previous feedback messages and reply to them appropriately. No other message metadata is collected aside from the ID of the user that sent the
message, to allow for handling if the system is abused and to allow messages to be sent back to the user.

### Text provided through commands
Anything given through commands may be saved as part of the functionality of the bot. For example, setting a server description means saving that description to the
database to allow you to post it at any time. Other commands such as setting configuration options, editing listings, and setting up reaction roles will also save
that information for future use.

## Removing data
Most data can easily be deleted by using the proper command to delete it. Note that this will not remove data from any existing backups of it, and that it is 
still possible to lose access to some data by leaving servers or removing the bot from your server.  
If you would like inaccessible data deleted, feel free to contact us using the information below.

## Contact
If desired, you can contact us at (GS)#6969 on Discord or [join the support server](https://discord.gg/EvDmXGt) to ask us to remove any other data. 
This is also where we can be contacted about privacy concerns if necessary.
